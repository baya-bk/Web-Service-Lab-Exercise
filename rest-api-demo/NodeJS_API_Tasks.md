# Node.js API Tasks

## **Task 1: Create a Simple Node.js Application with Express.js REST API**

Create a simple Node.js application that uses Express.js to implement a REST API with the following endpoints:

- **GET /users** to fetch a list of users.
- **POST /users** to create a new user.
- **PUT /users/id** to update a user by ID.
- **DELETE /users/id** to delete a user by ID.
- **PATCH /users/id** to partially update a user's information.

## **Task 2: Implement a REST API Endpoint to Handle a PUT Request**

Implement a REST API endpoint in Node.js to handle a **PUT** request that updates a specific user's **email** address.

## **Task 3: Create a Node.js REST API Handling POST and PATCH Methods**

Create a Node.js REST API that handles both the **POST** and **PATCH** methods:

- **POST** should create a new resource.
- **PATCH** should allow updating a single property of that resource (e.g., updating only the email of a user).
