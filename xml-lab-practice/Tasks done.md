# Tasks Completed

## **Task 1: XML Structure and Validation**
Created a simple XML document for a book, including fields for **title**, **author**, **year**, and **ISBN**. The XML document was validated against a **DTD (Document Type Definition)** schema. Errors were introduced into the XML document to test the validation process and understand the error messages.

## **Task 2: XML Parsing with JavaScript**
Wrote a JavaScript script to parse an XML document representing a book. The script extracts information such as **title** and **author** from the XML and displays it in the browser. The script was modified to display all book information in an HTML table.

## **Task 3: XML Transformation with XSLT**
Created an **XSLT** stylesheet to transform the book XML into an HTML table. The table was styled with CSS to make it visually appealing. The XSLT stylesheet was modified to sort the books by **publication year**.

## **Task 4: XML Data Binding with a Programming Language**
Implemented XML data binding using **Java** to parse the book XML document. A `Book` class was created to represent the book and populate it with data from the XML. A method was written to display the book information in a formatted way.

## **Task 5: Creating a Complex XML Schema**
Designed an **XSD schema** for a library catalog, which includes books, magazines, and DVDs. The schema defined complex data types and element relationships. XML documents were validated against the schema to ensure data integrity.

## **Task 6: Building a Web Service with XML**
Created a **Python-based REST web service** using **Flask** that serves book data as XML. A client-side **HTML page** was written to consume the XML data from the web service and display it dynamically in the browser. The service was configured to allow CORS to handle requests from different origins.

## **Task 7: XML-Based Configuration Files**
Created an **XML configuration file** for a software application, including settings for database connections, log levels, and user preferences. A **Python program** was written to read and apply the settings from the configuration file, displaying the parsed values for each configuration category.
